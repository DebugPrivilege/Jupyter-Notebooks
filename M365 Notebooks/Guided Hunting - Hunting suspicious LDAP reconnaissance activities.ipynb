    "You have discovered an LDAP query that you might think is 'suspicious', but you are not sure. In order to help you a step further in your analysis. We will go through a few checks. Here are a few examples that you might encounter during your hunting engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Description:</b>\n",
    "When looking at the *servicePrincipalName* attribute at the LDAP search filter. It can be a bit noisy, because there are legitimate administrative tasks, whereby IT Admins need to configure an SPN or there is a service running in the background and executing LDAP queries, like the Azure ATP sensor for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- <b>setspn.exe</b> | servicePrincipalName=http/sql.admin.abc.contoso.com\n",
    "- <b>sme.exe</b> | (&(ObjectCategory=computer)(operatingSystem=*server*)(!serviceprincipalname=ClusterVirtualServer*)(cn=clusterserver))\n",
    "- <b>microsoft.tri.sensor.exe</b> | (&(|(objectClass=user)(objectClass=computer))(servicePrincipalName=krbtgt/CONTOSO.COM))\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check if the LDAP query is generic (e.g. looking for all accounts with SPNs) or did it include a wildcard?\n",
    "\n",
    "    <b>Answer:</b> The LDAP search filter was generic and it looked like the following:\n",
    "     - SearchFilter: (&(objectCategory=user)(!(samAccountName=krbtgt)(servicePrincipalName=*)))\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evidence:</b> You can see that the LDAP search filter is looking for all accounts that have a SPN. servicePrincipalName=* means that it is looking for all the accounts with an SPN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check if you have encounter any interesting attributes in the LDAP search filters (e.g. ms-MCS-AdmPwd, adminCount, dnsNodes, trustedDomain)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check who is running the LDAP query? Is it Joe from Finance?"
